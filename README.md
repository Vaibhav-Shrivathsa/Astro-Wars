## Astro Wars

An "Astro Party"-like game made with pygame, featuring acceleration-based physics for player
ships, collision detection and resolution, various menus, multiple maps, and a dynamic camera system that zooms in when
players get closer together and shakes when objects are destroyed.

Two players control ships that can turn and shoot. Strike the other player with a bullet in order to win! Yellow blocks can be destroyed with bullets as well.
